# Four Document System README

## Overview
Based on: https://worksonmymachine.ai/p/nobody-knows-how-to-build-with-ai

### The Architecture Overview
- Started as a README. "Here's what this thing probably does, I think."
- The Architecture Overview isn't really architecture. It's "what would I want to know if I had amnesia?"

### The Technical Considerations
- My accumulated frustrations turned into documentation. Every time Claude had trouble, we added more details.
- The Technical Considerations aren't really instructions. They're "what would frustrate me if we had to repeat it?"

### The Workflow Process
- I noticed I kept doing the same dance. So I had Claude write down the steps. Now I follow my own instructions like they're sacred text. They're not. They're just what happened to work this time.
- The Workflow Process isn't really process. It's "what patterns emerged that I don't want to lose?"

### The Story Breakdown
- Everything in 15-30 minute chunks. Why? Because that's roughly how long before Claude starts forgetting what we discussed ten minutes ago. Like a goldfish with a PhD.
- The Story Breakdown isn't really planning. It's "how do I make progress when everything resets?"
