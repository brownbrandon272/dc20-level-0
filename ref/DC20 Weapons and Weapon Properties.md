**Weapon Properties**

Weapons have certain properties that grant them different benefits or drawbacks.

- Ammo: This Weapon requires ammunition to make Attacks. You can load a Weapon as part of an Attack made with it.

- Concealable: Drawing the Weapon doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks. If you draw the Weapon as part of an Attack, you have ADV on the Attack. You can only gain this benefit once against each creature per Combat.

- Guard: You gain +1 PD while wielding the Weapon.

- Heavy: The Weapon's damage increases by 1.

- Impact: You deal +1 damage on Heavy Hits.

- Long-Ranged: Your Range increases to 30/90.

- Multi-Faceted: The Weapon gains a second Weapon Style. When you make an Attack with the Weapon, you must choose which Weapon Style to use. The chosen Weapon Style determines the Attack's damage type.

- Reach: This Weapon adds 1 Space to your Melee Range when you Attack with it.

- Reload: The Weapon's damage increases by 1, but you must spend 1 AP and use a free hand to reload the Weapon.

DC Tip: If you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon using a Reaction, the Weapon must already be loaded to perform the Attack.

- Silent: When you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon while Hidden, you remain Unheard by creatures you're Hidden from.

DC Tip: You must be both Unseen and Unheard to be Hidden. If you become seen while making the Attack, you are no longer Hidden.

- Toss: You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (5/10).

- Thrown: You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (10/20).

- Two-Handed: The Weapon requires 2 hands when you Attack with it.

- Unwieldy: You have DisADV on Attacks made with the Weapon against targets within 1 Space of you.

DC Tip: The DisADV from Unwieldy stacks with the DisADV that Ranged Weapons get when they make Attacks against a target that are within 1 Space of you (making it DisADV 2).

- Versatile: This Weapon can be wielded with 1 or 2 hands. When you wield the Weapon with 2 hands, you gain a +2 bonus to Hit using it.
